## Introduction

Versal™ adaptive SoCs combine programmable logic (PL), processing system (PS), and AI Engines with leading-edge memory and interfacing technologies to deliver powerful heterogeneous acceleration for any application. The hardware and software are targeted for programming and optimization by data scientists and software and hardware developers. A host of tools, software, libraries, IP, middleware, and frameworks enable Versal adaptive SoCs to support all industry-standard design flows.

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you should be able to:

* Use Verilog or System Verilog modules to drive traffic in and out of an ADF graph running in the AIE Simulator.

* Create a setup for Verilog/SV based traffic generator running with AIEsim or x86sim process.

* Integrate your own RTL running in external process with AIEsim or x86sim process.

* Run the external Verilog/System Verilog based traffic generator with XSIM as well as other third party simulators.

* Use python-based automation to generate AMD Vivado™ Design Suite TCL scripts and aie instantiable module for your external testbench.

*Note: Note: External Traffic Generators provides only the PL stream traffic injection and recording capabilities for
AI Engine Simulation without any expectation of Cycle Accuracy or Cycle Locked simulation.

**IMPORTANT**: Before beginning the tutorial make sure you have installed the Vitis 2024.1 software. The Vitis release includes all the embedded base platforms including the VCK190 base platform that is used in this tutorial. In addition, ensure you have downloaded the Common Images for Embedded Vitis Platforms from this link: https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-platforms/2024.1.html. The common image package contains a prebuilt Linux kernel and root file system that can be used with the Versal board for embedded design development using Vitis.

Before starting this tutorial run the following steps:

1. Go to the directory where you have unzipped the Versal Common Image package.
2. In a Bash shell run the `/Common Images Dir/xilinx-versal-common-v2024.1/environment-setup-cortexa72-cortexa53-xilinx-linux` script. This script sets up the `SDKTARGETSYSROOT` and `CXX` variables. If the script is not present, you must run the `/Common Images Dir/xilinx-versal-common-v2024.1/sdk.sh`.
3. Set up your `ROOTFS`, and `IMAGE` to point to the `rootfs.ext4` and `Image` files located in the `/Common Images Dir/xilinx-versal-common-v2024.1` directory.
4. Set up your `PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS` environment variable to `$XILINX_VITIS/base_platforms/`.

## Section 1: Overview of the Design that Will be Used in this Tutorial

The following figure gives an overview of how the data will flow through this example design.

![Alt Text](images/user_RTL_ext_PLIO_conn.png)

The following table gives a brief overview of all the functionalities involved.

Name    | Type           | Functionality
---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------
Interpolator|AIE Kernel|Interpolate using two samples by taking in 128 cint16 samples block as input and producing 256 cint16 samples block as an output.
Polar Clip|User RTL|Performs threshold detection and clipping.
Classifier|AIE Kernel|Does some simple classification as per complex plane and produces plane numbers (from 0 to 3) based on the complex value.

There are two AIE kernels communicating with the user RTL block. The AIE kernels have four PLIOs, two being file I/Os i.e., ```in_interpolator``` and ```out_classifier``` and the other two being external I/Os i.e., ```out_interpolator``` and ```in_classifier``` responsible for propagating traffic in/out of the AIE kernels from the external process running the user RTL block.

### Directory Structure

```
19-aie_external_io_sv
|- images
|- data
|- user_rtl
|-aie
|  - kernels
|-my_top.v
```

This example contains Verilog design (user RTL code) in the `ext_rtl` folder. The external Verilog testbench is present at the top named as `my_top.v`.  

## Section 2: How to Integrate External RTL (Verilog/SV) Based Traffic Generator with AIE

To establish the connection between the RTL and the AIE kernel's external PLIOs, the XTLM_IPC SystemC modules are required for the interface between an RTL and AIE kernel and these stubs are present inside external aie wrapper stub module which includes all the XTLM IPC modules and needs to be instantiated in the external testbench to establish the connection as mentioned in the following figure. The axi_stream connections from the RTL kernel are made to the stub which transfers the data to AIE kernel and vice versa as seen in following figure.

### Generating AIE Wrapper Stub Module

The AIE wrapper stubs will be generated based on the external PLIO declarations in the ADF graph. You need to follow below steps for generating these stubs for the AIE. 

1. Perform the ADF graph compilation to generate `scsim_config.json` file that resides in `Work/config/scsim_config.json` directory. This config file contains information on the PLIOs declared in the graph.

    ```
    v++ -c --mode aie --platform=$(PLATFORM) --aie.pl-freq 500 --aie.adf-api-log-level 3 --include=./aie  --output=graph.json aie/graph.cpp
    ```

    or

    ```
    make compile PLATFORM=$PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS/xilinx_vck190_base_202310_1/xilinx_vck190_base_202310_1.xpfm
    ```

2. Using this config file as argument to the ``gen_aie_wrapper.py`` script, you can autogenerate Verilog stub modules based on ext PLIO declared in ADF Graph.

    ```bash 
    python3 ${XILINX_VITIS}/data/emulation/scripts/gen_aie_wrapper.py -json Work/config/scsim_config.json --mode <wrapper/vivado> 
    ```

* Tip: The python script is available in the Vitis install area as mentioned in above path. There are two modes for the script i.e., ```wrapper``` and ```vivado``` mode. By default, the script runs in Vivado mode. If run with ```wrapper``` mode, it only generates ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb.v```.
* For x86simulation, you will have to manually write this wrapper as `scsim_config.json` is not available for x86sim flow.

The name of the instance stubs must be identical to the name of the corresponding external PLIOs in graph.h ("in_classifier" and "out_interpolator" as mentioned below), and these name of the instances `in graph.h` will be reflected in the generated ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb.v``` file.

```bash
pl_in0 = adf::input_plio::create("in_classifier",adf::plio_32_bits);
out0 = adf::output_plio::create("out_interpolator",adf::plio_32_bits);
```

After step 2, you can see ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb.v``` is generated that has instances of sim_ipc_axis modules that can be directly instantiated in your external testbench.

### Adding User RTL and External Testbench

The design used in this tutorial has ```polar_clip``` user RTL located inside ```user_rtl/``` directory and the external testbench as ```my_top.v```.

### Instantiating aie wrapper in the External Testbench

The aie wrapper module (`aie_wrapper_ext_tb.v`) needs to be instantiated in the external testbench (`my_top.v` or `my_top.sv`). You can open `my_top.v` and see the aie_wrapper instantiation.  

The aiesim expects data to be in beats instead of transaction. So, you need to keep tlast at high (```1'b1```) all the time in my_top.v as follows:

![Alt Text](images/ext_tb.png)

* Note: You can add ```timescale``` directive as per your requirement in `aie_wrapper_ext_tb.v`.  

### Generating sim_ipc_axis IPs for Vivado Project

By default, the python script generates ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl``` and ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl``` along with the wrapper Verilog file as mentioned in above section.

There are two ways to proceed based on the existence of the Vivado project. This tutorial can be run using ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl``` if there is no available project already created using Vivado. If you have your Vivado project, use the IP flow i.e., ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl```.

* If you have already created a Vivado project, this Tcl script can be used for generating required sim_ipc_axis IPs. From within the existing Vivado project, inside the Tcl console source ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl```. In the Vivado Tcl console, run the following command:

  ```source <absolute_path>/aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl```

  ![Alt Text](images/vivado_project.png)

You need to ensure that project directory and `aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl` directory are the same. If `aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl` is in another directory, provide appropriate path while sourcing it.
This tcl script is responsible for generating sim_ipc_axis IPs in Vivado project.  

After sourcing the tcl file, you will see hierarchy created in sim_1 fileset under Simulation_sources.

  ![Alt Text](images/vivado_project_h.png)

You can add the required files and directories for your project as mentioned in the following figure:

![Alt Text](images/add_vivado_sources.png)

![Alt Text](images/add_vivado_sources_1.png)

You will see the updated hierarchy in Vivado.

![Alt Text](images/vivado_hierarchy.png)

* If a Vivado project is not created, use ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl```. You need to update ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl``` for the choice of simulator you want to use. Set line no. 19 to the choice of simulator xsim/questa/VCS/xcelium/riviera. If SIMULATOR is set to "xsim", comment out line no. 21 to 38. For other third party simulators, you need to update the required paths for SIMULATOR_GCC_PATH, SIMULATOR_CLIBS_PATH and INSTALL_BIN_PATH. For more details on how to set the third party simulators, please refer Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Logic Simulation [(UG900)](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug900-vivado-logic-simulation/Simulating-with-Third-Party-Simulators).

![Alt Text](images/Aie_wrapper_ext_proj_tcl.png)

On the terminal, run the following command:

```bash
source vivado/vitis
vivado -mode batch -source aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl
```

On sourcing `aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl`, it will generate ```export_sim``` directory. The ```export_sim``` directory has sub-directories with scripts required for using with other simulators. This Tcl script internally sources ```aie_wrapper_ext_tb_ip.tcl```.
These scripts contains only sim_ipc_axis modules. So, it is your responsibility to add any extra required RTL modules and options in the scripts.

You can modify and directly include desired user RTL inside the `aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl` as seen in the following figure:

![Alt Text](images/user_RTL.png)

## Section 3: Launch the external process with AIEsim process

After completing section 2, once required scripts are generated, you can launch the external process as follows:

* If already inside the Vivado project, once the project hierarchy is updated after adding the required sources as mentioned in section 2, you can run the simulation as folows:  

![Alt Text](images/run_simulation.png)

Parallelly, you can run the aiesimulator on your Linux terminal using the following command.

  ```aiesimulator --pkg-dir Work --profile``` 

Once both external process and AIEsim process are launched, you can start seeing traffic propagating to and from the user RTL as per the following waveform:

![Alt Text](images/ext_RTL_traffic.png)

* If outside the Vivado project, once the export_sim directory is generated with required simulation scripts, you can traverse inside XSIM directory and run ```<top_module_name>.sh``` script to launch the RTL simulation. Also, parallelly launch the AIEsimulator process as already mentioned. The name of the simulator script is based on the name of the top module which is aie_wrapper in this tutorial. The ```<top_module_name>.sh``` script is generated for every simulator that can be used to launch the simulation process. You can find the simulator scripts generated in below path.

  ```
  export_sim/xsim/<top_module_name>.sh
  ```

Update `aie_wrapper.sh` script line no. 72 to launch ```XSIM``` in GUI mode by adding ```--gui``` flag.

Go inside the desired simulator directory and trigger the simulator script (`aie_wrapper.sh`) to launch the simulation.

Also, update the generated ```cmd.tcl``` file (line no. 11) to run the simulation for desired timestamp or ```run all``` so that traffic can be analyzed. You can manually terminate the simulation once traffic is seen propagating between PL-AIE and you have analyzed the same.

When simulation is launched, you can see the traffic propagating to and from the user RTL.

## Section 4: External RTL simulation in XSIM and Other Third Party Simulator Support

The external RTL simulation is supported for XSIM and all other third party simulators. You can find the respective simulator scripts generated inside the ```export_sim``` directory as per the following directory structure.

```
export_sim/<simulator_name>/<top_module_name>.sh
```

Once you finish to analyze the traffic from PL to AIE and AIE to PL, the AIE simulator and RTL simulation should be manually terminated. No Pass/Fail check is done.

## Section 5: More on Traffic Generators

This tutorial talks about Verilog/SV based traffic generators and users can also try C-based/Python based traffic generators with AIE. For more details, please refer the tutorial [16-external-traffic-generator-aie](../16-external-traffic-generator-aie)

You can also integrate traffic generators with AIE flows i.e., AIEsim/x86sim or emulation flows i.e., SW emulation or HW emulation. For more details, refer [Adding-Traffic-Generators-to-Your-Design](https://docs.amd.com/r/en-US/ug1393-vitis-application-acceleration/Adding-Traffic-Generators-to-Your-Design).

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to drive traffic from external Verilog/System-Verilog traffic generators/testbenches to the AIE simulator. For the same, you need to make the appropriate port connections between the AIE kernels, the aie wrapper stubs (for internally connecting XTLM IPC stubs) and the RTL kernel.

* Note - Supported simulators are Xsim and all the third party simulators (Questa/Riviera/Xcelium/VCS).
* Note - You must provide the simulator installer path, gcc path and clibs path in `aie_wrapper_ext_tb_proj.tcl` script based on the choice of third party simulator.
