## Design Tutorials

The AI Engine Development Design Tutorials showcase the two major phases of AI Engine-ML application development: architecting the application and developing the kernels. Both phases are demonstrated in these tutorials.

<tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="../../../Developer_Contributed/01-Versal_Custom_Thin_Platform_Extensible_System/">Versal Custom Thin Platform Extensible System</a></td>
 <td>This is a Versal system example design based on a VEK280 thin custom platform (Minimal clocks and AXI exposed to PL) that includes HLS/RTL kernels and AI Engine kernel using a full Makefile build-flow.</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./01-AIE-ML-programming-and-optimization/">AIE-ML Programming</a></td>
 <td>This tutorial helps user understand the differences between AI Engine and AI Engine-ML architecture, it is based on matrix multiplication which is a usual algorithm in Machine Learning applications. </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./02-Prime-Factor-FFT/">Prime Factor FFT-1008 on AIE-ML</a></td>
 <td>This Versal system example implements a 1008-pt FFT using the Prime Factor algorithm. The design uses both AI Engine and PL kernels working cooperatively. AI Engine elements are hand-coded using AIE API, PL elements are implemented using Vitis HLS. System integration in Vitis is managed using the new v++ Unified Command Line flow. This tutorial targets the AIE-ML architecture. </td>

 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./03-AIE-ML-lenet_tutorial/">AIE-ML LeNet Tutorial</a></td>
 <td>This tutorial uses the LeNet algorithm to implement a system-level design to perform image classification using the AIE-ML architecture and PL logic, including block RAM (BRAM). The design demonstrates functional partitioning between the AIE-ML and PL. It also highlights memory partitioning and hierarchy among DDR memory, PL (BRAM), Memory tile and AI Engine memory. </td>

 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./04-AIE-API-based-FFT-for-many-instances-applications/">AIE API based FFT for Many Instances Applications</a></td>
 <td>This tutorial walks the user through the design and the implementation of an FFT for many parallel signals on a Real-Time system, using the AI Engine APIs. The design performance objective is minimizing power and utilization, maintaining a high throughput to at least match the Real-Time acquisition bandwidth. Moreover, the design leverages the AIE-ML Memory Tiles to minimize programmable logic utilization. The considered case study comprises 128 parallel signals, each with a 125MSa/s sample rate and CINT16 datatype, with a total aggregated bandwidth of 64GBytes/s. </td>

 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./05-Softmax-Function/">Softmax Function on AIE-ML</a></td>
 <td>Softmax is an activation function often used in the output layer of a neural network designed for multi-class classification. This tutorial provides an example of how the softmax function might be implemented for those desiring to develop custom machine learning inference applications on AI Engines. </td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
 <td align="center"><a href="./06-farrow_filter/">Migrating Farrow Filter from AIE to AIE-ML</a></td>
 <td>A fractional delay filter is a common digital signal processing (DSP) algorithm found in many applications including digital receivers in modems and is required for timing synchronization. The Fractional Delay Farrow Filter design has already been implemented for the AIE architecture. This tutorial guides how to migrate the existing Fractional Delay Farrow Filter design from AIE to AIE-ML architecture. </td>
